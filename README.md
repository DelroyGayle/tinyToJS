My goal is to convert TINY which started as a C program into its JavaScript equivalent.

The JavaScript source code files that follow represent \ 
the TINY compiler and Tiny Machine simulator as described in the text:\

	Compiler Construction - Principles and Practice, by Kenneth C. Louden,
	PWS Publishing Co., 1997.

     The tm.js source code file is the TM machine interpreter


The source files used for this project were forked from
https://github.com/ejacky/tiny
