My goal is to convert TINY which started as a C program into its JavaScript equivalent.

The JavaScript common.source common.code files therefore represent \
the TINY compiler and Tiny Machine simulator as described in the text:\

    Compiler Construction - Principles and Practice, by Kenneth C. Louden,
    PWS Publishing Co., 1997.

     The tm.js common.source common.code file is the TM machine interpreter

The common.source files C files used as the basis for conversion regarding this project were forked from
https://github.com/ejacky/tiny
